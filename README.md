India Box
========

Arduino sketch for the India Box, an attempt at creating an aural equivalent to the venerable photo album. Field recordings made whilst in India were edited in Pro Tools and then loaded onto a micro SD card, which once combined with a Arduino, MP3 decoder, 3W Stereo amplifier, and an old Indian biscuit tin provide a lasting memory of the holiday.
Functionally it couldn't be much simpler, on/off switches and a simple momentary push-button which plays a random track are the only controls.
